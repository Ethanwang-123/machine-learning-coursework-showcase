# Machine Learning Coursework Showcase

This repository contains selected machine learning implementations completed as part of a university-level ML course.

The focus of this repository is on core algorithm implementation, experimental analysis, and evaluation rather than end-to-end production systems.

## Contents

### Regression
`regression/`
- Linear regression models and extensions
- Model fitting and evaluation on structured datasets

### Classification
`classification/`
- Supervised classification methods
- Performance comparison and analysis

### Clustering
`clustering.ipynb`
- Unsupervised learning experiments
- Clustering evaluation and visualisation

### Sequential Data
`sequential_data/`
- Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Sequence modelling and inference

## Notes
- Code is organised by learning objective
- This repository contains selected coursework implementations
- Intended for demonstration and review purposes
